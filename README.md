# JavaScript and DOM Manipulation / ALIENS-R-REAL
This project implements a website using HTML, CSS, and D3.js. Using D3.js, a UFO sightings dataset can be filtered.

Most HTML, CSS, and data was provided by the class; but I did make some adjustments as necessary. 
This was mostly to practice JavaScript.

## How To Run
To access the site click here: [UFO Sightings](https://12wollmana.github.io/UMN-Data_Analytics-JavaScript_Challenge/).

Use the filter controls to adjust what information is in the table.

The table should change as selections are made.

Click the "Reset Table" button to clear all selections.
